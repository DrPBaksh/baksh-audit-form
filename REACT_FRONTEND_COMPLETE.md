## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Setup and Installation
```bash
cd react-frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file:
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/dev
```

### 3. Development Testing
```bash
npm start  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Deployment
Make the deployment script executable:
```bash
chmod +x react-frontend/deploy.sh
```

Deploy the React frontend:
```bash
cd react-frontend
./deploy.sh --owner=your-name
```

### 5. Integration Testing
After deployment, test the complete flow:
```bash
./run_tests.sh  # Run existing API tests
```

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

### From Original Frontend To React
- **Maintainability**: Component-based architecture vs scattered JavaScript
- **User Experience**: Smooth animations, better loading states, progress tracking
- **Development**: Hot reloading, modern tooling, type safety ready
- **Performance**: Code splitting, optimized bundles, caching strategies
